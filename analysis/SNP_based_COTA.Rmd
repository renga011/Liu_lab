## Introduction


```{r}

## I. What do we need and where are we getting it from?
  For SNP based COTA, we try to map SNP --> Gene --> Trait (AD) mediation paths. We are executing SNP based COTA with the pQTLs from Cruchaga et al. (2023, Nat.Genetics). They mapped pQTLs for ~7023 proteins. We downloaded the pQTL p values for these proteins and thereafter, subsetted the file to include only the AD-GWAS significant SNPs (p < 1e-05) from Bellenguez et al. (2022). For understanding the gene effect on AD, we use the burden score p values from whole exome sequencing (WES) studies.
